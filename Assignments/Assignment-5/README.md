# ParallelArrays

## Requirements

Taken from https://programmingbydoing.com/a/parallel-arrays.html

Create three arrays to store data about five people. The first array should be Strings and should hold their last names. The next array should be doubles and should hold a grade average (on a 100-point scale). The last array should be ints, should hold their student id numbers.

Give each of the arrays values (using array initializers). Then print the values of all three arrays on the screen.

Finally, ask the user for an ID number to lookup. Search through the ID array until you find that ID, and print out the values from the same slot number of the other two arrays.
